# Custom Worm Timing
Modifies the time it takes for the Earth Leviathan to emerge.

When the worm attacks and the ground starts shaking, the worm takes a random amount of time to pop out and actually kill you. By default this mod changes the vanilla range (0.33 seconds - 2 seconds) to a slightly smaller range (0.66 seconds - 2 seconds), removing the random chance of it being most likely impossible to escape. This lower bound is still very difficult if you encounter it, so the timing can also be configured!
