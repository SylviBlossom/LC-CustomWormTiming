# Custom Worm Timing
Modifies the time it takes for the Earth Leviathan to emerge.

By default it changes the vanilla range (0.33 seconds - 2.33 seconds) to a slightly smaller range (0.66 seconds - 2 seconds), keeping the average the same but removing the 1 in 7 chance of an instakill worm, but the timing remains difficult and can be made more or less lenient if desired by changing the values in the config.

## Warning
Config synchronization is not yet tested in multiplayer, so make sure all clients have the same config!
