# Custom Worm Timing
Modifies the time it takes for the Earth Leviathan to emerge.

When the worm attacks and the ground starts shaking, the worm takes a random amount of time to pop out and actually kill you. As of **v50**, this timing is lenient, so this mod is updated for configurability purposes. The default timing values in the config are equal to the vanilla ones (1 second - 2 seconds).
